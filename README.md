# Born2BeRoot

This project aims to introduce the students to virtualization by creating their first machine in VirtualBox under specific instructions.

Virtualization, as explained in ibm.com, "uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.".

But... what is a VM? A VM, as define in vmware.com, "is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual macOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.".

VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.

At the end of this project, I was able to set up my own operating system while implementing strict rules.
